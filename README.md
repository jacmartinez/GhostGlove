WHY ARE YOU HERE OH WAIT, this website was made to show why i want to be in website design DUH!! 
I wanted to join Website design in order to show that there is a community that is so strong and patient within one another.
It's truly mesmerizing just seeing the connection we all have, and truly being able to understand one anothers differences.
